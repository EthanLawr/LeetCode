## Why this repo

- Elegant, minimal solutions in multiple languages you can read in under a minute.
- Each problem folder contains runnable code and a concise README explaining the problem and the solutions included.
- Organization: one folder per problem, named "XXXX. Problem Name" (problem number first for easy sorting).

## How to use

1. Open the folder for the problem you care about (names start with the problem number).
2. Read the problem `README.md` for a short statement and examples.
3. Open the language file you prefer — each file is self-contained unless otherwise noted.

## Running examples (PowerShell)

```powershell
# JavaScript
node .\0001.` Two Sum`\Javascript.js

# Python
python .\0001.` Two Sum`\Python3.py
```

## Style & conventions

- Files are named by language (e.g., `Javascript.js`, `Python3.py`) for quick scanning.
- READMEs follow a compact template: Title → Statement → Examples → Solutions list → Notes.
- Code aims for readability first; micro-optimizations only where meaningful.
